# Python Data Story - World Happiness Report

### Introduction:

Welcome to my Python Data Story project, where I explore the World Happiness Report dataset sourced from Kaggle. In this project, I delve into the fascinating world of global happiness and examine the relationships among various variables to uncover insights into what factors contribute to overall happiness.

Data Exploration:

Using Python, I downloaded and preprocessed the World Happiness Report dataset, ensuring it was clean and ready for analysis. The dataset contains a wealth of information, including country-level data on factors such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.

Key Visualizations:

Correlation Heatmap: I started by creating a correlation heatmap to visualize the relationships between different variables. This provided an overview of which factors are strongly correlated with happiness and which factors have weaker correlations.
Scatter Plots: I then proceeded to create scatter plots to explore specific relationships in more detail. For example, I plotted GDP per capita against happiness score to see if there's a clear relationship between wealth and happiness. Similarly, I examined the relationship between social support and happiness, freedom to make life choices and happiness, and other relevant variables.
Bar Charts: To compare the average happiness scores across different regions or countries, I created bar charts. This allowed me to identify which regions or countries tend to have higher levels of happiness and which ones lag behind.
Line Plots: Finally, I used line plots to visualize trends over time. By plotting happiness scores over multiple years, I could observe whether there have been any significant changes in global happiness levels over time and whether certain factors have become more or less influential over the years.
Insights:

Through this data exploration process, I gained several insights into the determinants of happiness worldwide. For instance, I discovered that while GDP per capita does have a positive correlation with happiness, it's not the sole determinant. Factors such as social support, freedom to make life choices, and perceptions of corruption also play significant roles in determining a country's happiness level.

Conclusion:

The Python Data Story - World Happiness Report project not only showcases my data analysis and visualization skills but also provides valuable insights into the complex factors that contribute to happiness on a global scale. By examining the relationships among various variables, I've gained a deeper understanding of what truly makes people happy and how policymakers and individuals alike can work towards creating happier societies.

Explore the visualizations and insights in this project to gain a new perspective on the factors that drive happiness around the world.

# Python Time Series Analysis - Airline Passengers Dataset

### Introduction:

Welcome to my Python time series analysis project, where I've explored the Airline Passengers dataset. This dataset, sourced from an open repository on GitHub, contains monthly airline passenger numbers from 1949 to 1960. Leveraging Python for data exploration and Plotly for interactive graphing, I've conducted a comprehensive analysis of the dataset to uncover insights into passenger trends over time.

![Visual]( stuff/passengers .png)


Data Exploration:

Using Python libraries such as Pandas and Plotly, I've loaded and preprocessed the Airline Passengers dataset. This involved parsing dates, handling missing values, and ensuring the dataset's suitability for time series analysis.

Key Analyses:

Time Series Plot: I began by creating a time series plot to visualize the overall trend in airline passenger numbers over the entire period. This provided an initial understanding of how passenger numbers have evolved over time.
Seasonal Decomposition: Next, I performed seasonal decomposition to separate the time series into its trend, seasonal, and residual components. This allowed me to identify any recurring patterns or seasonal fluctuations in passenger numbers.
Trend Analysis: I conducted a detailed analysis of the trend component to identify long-term growth or decline trends in airline passenger numbers. This involved fitting trend lines and analyzing their slopes over different time intervals.
Seasonal Analysis: I explored the seasonal component to understand the seasonal variations in passenger numbers throughout the year. By visualizing seasonal patterns and calculating seasonal indices, I gained insights into peak travel seasons and off-peak periods.
Interactive Graphs:

Utilizing Plotly, I created interactive graphs that enable users to explore the data dynamically. These interactive visualizations allow users to zoom in on specific time periods, hover over data points for detailed information, and customize the display to focus on specific aspects of the data.

Insights:

Through this time series analysis, I uncovered several insights into the trends and patterns in airline passenger numbers. For example, I identified seasonal peaks during holiday seasons and summer months, as well as long-term growth trends reflecting the expansion of air travel over the decades.

Conclusion:

The Python Time Series Analysis - Airline Passengers Dataset project demonstrates my proficiency in conducting time series analysis and visualizing data using Python and Plotly. By exploring the historical trends in airline passenger numbers, I've provided valuable insights that can inform strategic decision-making in the aviation industry and guide forecasting efforts for future passenger demand.
